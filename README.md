# Monash_2018_S1
#### Datasets, resources and own ipynb files for all units in Monash Uni during the 2018 Semester 1
>  **Instrutions:**
- To find files for each unit, just go down into the folder with the code for each unit and dive into the correspodning sub-folder like wk2 or assign1
- To confirm that is me if the visitor is my classmates or teammates, verify my student id : 28491300 and name : Boyu Zhang
- Seperated environments have been created by unit code for different units, which refers to the .yml file with the unit code as the name like the 5148.yml; to ensure the code gets exactly the same output, create a same environment as mine and run the notebooks in it.
- To create a same environment,take the 5148 unit as a example,type the command:
	```conda create -f 5148.yml``` which will create a same enviroment naming 5148
- To activate a environment:
	```source acitvate 5148	``` on **linux/mac** or
	```activate 5148``` on **windows**
- Alwways remember to check whether you are running the notebook using the kernel that belongs to the intended environment to avoid import error or version conflicts
- For one not familiar wiht the usage of conda like env creation/management/sharing, it is strongly recommend to give this link: [managing environments](https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html) a close look
- For git/github novice, check out this [book](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) from the git creator, whihch is a quite handy and useful tool, if time is a big concern, it is encouraged that al least finish the second chapter with full attention and effort. You can just use this repository as a starting point by: `git clone the_url_of_this_repository` to get a copy of the repo on your local machine
