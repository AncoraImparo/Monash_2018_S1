# Monash_2018_S1
**Datasets, resources and own ipynb files for all units in Monash Uni during the 2018 Semester 1**
- To find files for each unit, just go down into the folder with the code for each unit and dive into the correspodning sub-folder like wk2 or assign1
- To confirm that is me if the visitor is my classmates or teammates, verify my student id : 28491300 and name : Boyu Zhang
- seperated environments have been created by unit code for different units, which refers to the .yml file with the unit code as the name like the 5148.yml; to ensure the code gets exactly the same output, create a same environment as mine and run the notebooks in it.
- To create a same environment, type the command:
	```conda create -f 5148.yml``` which will create a same enviroment naming 5148
- To activate a environment:
	```source acitvate 5148	``` on **linux/mac** or
	```activate 5148``` on **windows**
- Alwways remember to check whether you are running the notebook using the kernel that belongs to the intended environment to avoid import error or version conflicts
