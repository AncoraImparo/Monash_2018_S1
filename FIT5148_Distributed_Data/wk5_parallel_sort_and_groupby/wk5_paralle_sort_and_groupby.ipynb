    "## 1. Serial External Sorting based on Sort-Merge\n",
    "\n",
    "The serial sorting method we consider is serial external sorting which is external sorting in a uniprocessor environment. The most common serial external sorting algorithm is based on sort-merge. The underlying idea is that we (1) break the given record set into unsorted sub-record sets, (2) sort the sub-record sets, and (3) merge them into larger and larger sorted sub-record sets until the entire record set is sorted. In the real-word, each sub-record set is replaced by a file.\n",
    "### Note\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to determine the size of each sub-record set to be sorted. Each sub-record set must be small enough to fit into the main memory. The size of these sub-record sets is determined by the buffer size in main memory, which is to be used for sorting each sub-record set internally.\n",
