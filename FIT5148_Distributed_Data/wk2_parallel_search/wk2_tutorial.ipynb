    "\n",
    "Parallel search algorithms have three main elements:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - processor activation or involvement\n",
    "   - local searching method\n",
    "   - key comparison\n",
    "\n",
    "Processor activation or involvement indicates the number of processors to be used by the algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "Local searching method is the searching method to be applied to the processor(s). The search method is dependent upon the data ordering. If the data has already been sorted, then a binary search can be used, and otherwise, a linear search can be conducted.\n",
    "\n",
    "Searching basically consists of comparing the data from the table with the condition specified by the user. When a match is found, there are two options: whether to continue the comparison process in order to find more matches, or whether to stop the entire process. It is obvious that the key comparison is dependent upon whether the search attribute values are, or are not, unique.\n",
    "3.1 Parallel Searching for Exact Match\n",
    "\n",
    "In this activity, we will understand and practice how parallel searching works for exact match search for a given query. Note that the number of processors to perform parallel searching is dependent on the data partitioning methods. For example, only one processor is needed if the data is already partioned with a range partitioning. In this case, there is no parallelism.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Exercise**: We build a parallel search algorithm for exact match. Processor activation will be given by the user as input. As a location searching method, we will use the above two search functions: linear search function (i.e. linear_search()) and binary search function (i.e. binary_search()). As a local comparison method, we assume that we stop when a match is found for brevity. As data partitioning methods, we attempt to use the four different partitioning methods we built above:\n",

    "   - Round-robin data partitioning (i.e. rr_partition()),\n",
    "   - Hash data partitioning (i.e. h_partition()),\n",
