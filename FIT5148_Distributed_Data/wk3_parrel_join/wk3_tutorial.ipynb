That is, a join operation implemented on each processor would employ a serial join algorithm. In Section 2, we will learn more about parallel join algorithms.\n",

    "Sort-merge join is based on sorting and merging operations. The first step of joining is to sort the two tables based on the joining attribute in an ascending order, and the second step is merging the two sorted tables. If the value of the joining attribute in R is smaller than that in S, it skips to the next value of the joining attribute in R. On the other hand, if the value of the joining attribute in R is greater than that in S, it skips to the next value of the joining attribute in S. When the two values match, the two corresponding records are concatenated and placed into the query result.\n",
